        <h2>Volunteer for SeaGL</h2>
        <p>
            We're looking for volunteers to assist with various tasks during the
            days of the conference. For the 2020 virtual conference we need talk MCs and help desk support.
            If you'd like to help out see our [call for volunteers](https://seagl.org/news/2020/10/05/call-for-volunteers.html)
			or email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }}.
        </p>
        <h2>Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors</h2>
        <p>
            We will have a virtual hall available for exhibitors for the 2020 virtual conference experience.
            There are several sponsorship levels for commercial enterprises,
            and free rooms available for local non-profit or educational
            organizations. Please see our <a href="/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">sponsors page</a>
