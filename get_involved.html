        <h2>Volunteer for SeaGL</h2>
        <p>
            We're looking for volunteers to assist with various tasks during the
            days of the conference. We need help directing attendees to rooms,
            helping speakers get set up, and fulfilling other random roles. If
            you'd like to help out, email us at {{ site.custom.a.email.participate }}.
        </p>
        <h2>Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors</h2>
        <p>
            We will have a small hall with tables available for exhibitors.
            There are several sponsorship levels for commercial enterprises,
            and free tables available for local non-profit or educational
            organizations. Please see our <a href="/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">sponsors page</a>
            for details.
