SeaGL is a grassroots technical conference dedicated to spreading awareness and
knowledge about the GNU/Linux community and free/libre/open-source
software/hardware. Our goal for SeaGL is to produce an event which is as
enjoyable and informative for those who spend their days maintaining hundreds of
servers as it is for a student who has only just started exploring technology
options. SeaGL's first year was 2013. The SeaGL web site is built with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and we use [OSEM](https://osem.io/) for event
management.
