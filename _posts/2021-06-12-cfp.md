Welcome to the 2021 SeaGL Call For Proposals!  As every year, we want to hear from YOU, and we're always looking for speakers who are traditionally underrepresented in tech, and people with perspectives uncommonly heard.  Because we're virtual for the second year in a row, there is opportunity for speakers anywhere in the world to submit talks!  In 2020, we had talks from four continents!!  So let's take advantage of our virtual closeness for another year.

### Code of Practice

### Code of Conduct

### How To Submit
First, you'll go to SeaGL's [OSEM](https://osem.seagl.org) and either create an account or log in to an account you have previously used, if you choose.  For those of you who have submitted before, this is the same system as the last several years.  We are working on migrating to a new system but it's not there just yet.

### Talk categories and "vibe"
SeaGL is a very special conference.  We're a community-focused Free/Libre Open Source Software annual event in Seattle, and for the last two years, all over the world!  We're looking for technical talks from folks who usually give community talks, and activism talks from folks who usually give coding deep dives, and so forth. We would love to see you out of your comfort zone.  The categories we used last year were, loosely: Security, Community, Career Development, Tech Culture, Tools, Virtual Life & Work, DevOps, Performance Art! and Miscellaneous, and we had amazing submissions as a result, like Devops Standup and several talks on labor organizing!  We're an independent bunch but we still like to take care of each other.

Some of the kinds of talks we are not looking for are sponsored talks, or a talk of any kind which is submitted on behalf of someone else.  If you would like to be a part of our community, the bar is not high, so we do ask that for your participation, it is fully you who wants to spend this time with us at SeaGL.

We're not very likely to accept broad introductory talks, but specific, scoped introductions to a discrete part of the Operations or Network/Sysadmin world are very sought after, and we also love talks on the broad theme of "hacking for good", and personal security as well.  Are you making choices for your personal technology outside of Amazon/Google/Apple/other giants?  We would love to hear about that too!
