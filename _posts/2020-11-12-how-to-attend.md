We are SO excited for the conference which begins TOMORROW!  Since we're fully online this year, let's talk about actually HOW to get online to watch talks and have a super social experience in your conference-going.

The **tl;dr** here is that you can go to [attend.seagl.org](https://attend.seagl.org) and enter your name.  You will be added to the broader SeaGL chat room and you will see instructions for how to join specific chat rooms for the talks you want to see, which will include links to watching the video feed of the talk.

#### Description of how talks will be delivered
The speaker will be delivering their talk in a private video conferencing room.  They will be in the "room" with only the moderator of the talk.  Then our tech team will direct that feed to a publicly facing URL.  Attendees can chat with each other and watch the video at [attend.seagl.org](https://attend.seagl.org).  At the conclusion of the talk, if the speaker wants  a Question and Answer period, the room moderator will read questions from the audience in the attend.seagl.org chat room.  The speaker will be able to answer any questions that the moderator reads.  There will further be chat-only moderators in rooms for each talk.  Our [Code of Conduct](https://seagl.org/code_of_conduct) applies in all of these virtual conferences, throughout the duration of the conference, and in our IRC channels before and after the conference.  You can see more details of our tech stack at our blog post [The SeaGL Experience, Virtually Speaking](https://seagl.org/news/2020/11/09/seagl-tech-stack.html)!

#### How to view a talk
First, go to [attend.seagl.org](https://attend.seagl.org).  Enter a name or handle you are comfortable with.  There is no registration required because we do not believe in requiring tracking to attend SeaGL.  If the name is not available, another name will be automatically assigned.  For IRC users, you can log onto #seagl on irc.freenode.net, but you do not need to be familiar with IRC in the least to attend SeaGL!

Then you'll be in a chat room called #seagl-welcome, and there will be regular automated announcements about what talk is going to be where.  You will see other channels you can join, like #seagl-Track1, 2, and 3, hallway track, and others.  It will look like this!

In the Track rooms, e.g. #seagl-track-1, #seagl-track-2, and #seagl-track-3, there will be a feed throughout both days playing the live feed of the talks, which you can watch by hitting the yellow button at the top right, called Join Video Call.  You will not be joining the conference room, but the link to watch the video passively.  Your interaction and participation is asked for in the track chat room, there is not a way to talk directly with the speaker during their talk.

At the end of the talk, if the speaker chooses to take questions (some will not, and that is ok!), please ask your question in chat and the moderator will relay questions on the video feed to the speaker.  Please remember to form your question in such a way that it requires a question mark at the end - in other words, we want genuine questions asked in good faith, and are hoping to avoid "story time"-style announcements from the audience.  Stories and anecdotes are for the talks, and questions are for answering by the speaker!  The moderators will be tuned to facilitate this, and will be very excited to pass on your real questions!

Each talk is 20 minutes.  The speaker optionally has 10 minutes for Q&A.  That makes 30 minutes total, with fifteen minutes between talks, which adds up 45 minute slots.  After 30 minutes, the talk is entirely over and we will be depending on our amazing tech team to move the feeds around for the next speaker - each speaker has their own "room."  This means that after the time is up, it is truly up, unlike a physical space where a little dallying is part of the talks!

This is a lot of information!  Remember, you can go to [attend.seagl.org](https://attend.seagl.org), enter your name, and get started - we'll help you when you arrive!  We cannot WAIT to see you.
