Have you ever wondered what our glorious inflatable seagull is named? Currently, it's anonymous! To
give our feathered friend a name, we've been hosting a naming contest on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/seagl) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@seagl) for the past
month and are now down to just TWO delightful names: **C'gul** and **Patch**. This is proving to be the
premier tournament of any kind this year, and this final match may be the most watched sports-ish
event this Summer. Olympics, shmolympics.

We need YOUR help choosing a name! [Vote
now](https://surveyjs.io/published?id=af9d7141-8a70-420c-8303-8de3ebe6e4b9) for your favorite and
help christen our seagull!
