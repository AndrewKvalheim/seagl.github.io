We need YOU!  To help us select keynoters for SeaGL 2020, November 13-14 of this year!  Please use our Form to [nominate a keynote speaker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jXtQI4qcz-o-PyF1EwsQyCos5th_ga8Pk67wPsDDY_A/).  We are looking for open source community members with experiences and stories to share.  We are, as always, looking for new candidates who have not keynoted before, who have a different perspective to share.  Our community is vast, therefore our keynotes must represent our community.  

So, please, share 
* your pie in the sky picks
* your mentor from your local user group
* someone who has advocated for open source outside of traditional tech
* someone who has worked on bringing open source to traditionally proprietary-only models
* someone who has challenged social norms in open source
* someone who has lifted others up who have challenged those norms
* your tinker friend, your friend known for <s>shitposting</s> clever tweeting
* someone in your office who recently showed you a shortcut through your favorite tools

And anyone else you think would make a terrific guest of honor at our community-focused open source conference!  You can let us know [right here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1jXtQI4qcz-o-PyF1EwsQyCos5th_ga8Pk67wPsDDY_A/).
