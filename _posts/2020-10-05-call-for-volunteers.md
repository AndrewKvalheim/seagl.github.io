SeaGL is approaching fast, and we need your help! SeaGL is a completely volunteer run conference,
and with our new ✨technical landscape ✨we're going to need some extra hands. Please email
participate@seagl.org if you're interested in volunteering, shifts are minimum 1 hour for any of
these positions:

### Help Desk
Be online on either video or chat to answer questions

- Dedicated help desk video channel - one position will primarily be answering questions in video, answering in chat if video is quiet
- Dedicated help desk chat channel - one position will be primarily answering questions on chat, answering on video if chat is quiet
- Answer questions about registration, recording, talk tracks, etc. We will provide FAQ fact sheet that will hopefully answer most questions, and give you direct contact info for Lucy and other staff for other questions

### Talk Emcee
Host the talk!

- Introduce the speaker if they'd like
- Give speaker time cues if they'd like
- Moderate questions (ask any typed in chat, "call" on people)
- Be in the talk 10 minutes before it starts to chat with the speaker, get name pronunciation + preferences, etc.
- Enforce Code of Conduct and time restraints

### Talk Technician
Ensure the talk goes smoothly

- Enforce Code of Conduct and time restraints
- Share pre-recorded talk
- Be technical support for the talk - we will have a technical training 2 weeks before the
  conference, and any more serious issues can be escalated to SeaGL staff.
- Get help from SeaGL staff if needed

All volunteers will be trained on the Code of Conduct and on their roles 2 weeks before the
conference - if you'd like to volunteer, we will do everything we can to ensure you feel prepared
before the conference!

**Please email participate@seagl.org if you're interested in volunteering or have questions**, and we will send you the sign-up sheet. We're happy to have you help whenever works for your schedule. SeaGL could not happen without our volunteers, and we would love to have you be a part of our community!
