SeaGL condemns racism in all its forms, systemic, intentional, and otherwise.  The organizers of SeaGL recognize the ongoing harm to the Black community and seek to support Black members of our community directly.  To that end, due to the conference no longer being in-person, we have allotted honoraria for all Black speakers at SeaGL 2020 and going forward.  We are also looking into the possibility of scholarships or other monetary support mechanisms for Black members of the FLOSS world.  We are currently strategizing on how best to support and amplify our sister technical organizations who focus on non-white members of our community.

In addition, we strive to not only make our community inclusive, but also to enforce BETTER behavior from white community members.  None of us are free from blame, including the nearly all-white organizing staff, and in the past we have failed to do enough to combat institutional racism in the tech industry. Our goal is for SeaGL to be an equitable conference by seeking out BIPOC voices, and supporting the Black FLOSS community in every way we can.

Furthermore, we condemn in the strongest of terms the actions of the Seattle Police Department in their unprovoked violence versus the people of Seattle, particularly versus the Black community of Seattle, in the protests of May and June of 2020 and over many years prior.  We recognize that genuinely all actions are political, and we will brook no racists at SeaGL. Our priority is underserved and underprivileged communities, and we want to ensure that for anyone attending SeaGL or participating in SeaGL-adjacent activities there is agreement on this point.

Thank you,
SeaGL Staff
