**OMG Only Two Days Until SeaGL Holy Smokes!**

Ladies, gentlemen, and geeks of all genders (or no gender at all)! Welcome to the final few two days before SeaGL 2018! We've a few final notes to share with you before the ðŸŽ‰ Big Event ðŸŽ‰â€¦

### Code of Conduct

SeaGL, like free software, is for everyone. It's paramount to us that all attendees feel (and be!) safe and welcome.

Please remember that all staff, presenters, and attendees of SeaGL are expected to obey the [Code of Conduct](https://seagl.org/code_of_conduct.html) not only at SeaGL but also in all SeaGL-associated spaces including but not limited to associated social events, the conference party, and the IRC channel.

If you have any concerns at all that are of a Code of Conduct nature, please email `coc AT seagl.org`Â as soon as possible. If you need immediate help, please locate any SeaGL staffer. We'll be wearing name tags that say **_STAFF_** so hopefully we'll be easy to spot.

### Onsite

The SeaGL site includes [maps to and of the venue and surrounding area](https://seagl.org/maps/2018.html), including information about parking should you need that sort of thing.

As the venue is a community college, it's able to support people of all types of accessibility needs. Please see [Seattle Central's accessibility page](https://seattlecentral.edu/campus-life/student-support-and-services/disability-support/accommodations) for complete information.

### Social media

We encourage people to get together, chat, and just generally share their SeaGL experiences. People are the best part of Free Software, after all.

If you share anything on your social network of choice, please use the `#seagl2018` hashtag so everyone can follow along. If you do the Twitter thing, please follow [@seagl](https://twitter.com/seagl) for up to the minute announcements and updates.

The sharing happens all day, so bring your tea to the expo hall in the morning on Saturday.
