Lisha Sterling is our third awesome keynote presenter for SeaGL 2019!

Benjamin Mako Hill is a social scientist, technologist, and activist. In all three roles, he works to understand why some attempts at [peer production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_production)—like Wikipedia and Linux—build large volunteer communities while the vast majority never attract even a second contributor. He is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Communication](http://www.com.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/) and a founding member of the [Community Data Science Collective](https://communitydata.cc/). He is also a Faculty Associate at the [Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](http://www.harvard.edu/). He has also been a leader, developer, and contributor to the free and open source software community for more than a decade as part of the [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) and [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) projects.
