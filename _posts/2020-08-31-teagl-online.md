If you're a SeaGL regular, or a SeaGL newbie who really loves trying new tea, this news is for you. The 3rd annual TeaGL is moving online, with a virtual tea time AND an online tea swap. The past two years, SeaGL community members have brought enough of their favorite tea (black, white, green, herbal, whatever!) to share, turning Saturday into the most relaxing (and caffeinated) day of the conference.

We're excited to bring this SeaGL favorite to the 2020 virtual conference. We're still brewing up the details, so watch the website and social media for more information on the virtual tea time and how to participate. Until then, pinkies up!
